          I think it's better if we take out this functionality and leave it to the floor component that would connect it 
          back to the building. It doesn't make much sense to me for each floor to display what they are when a building only
          really cares about the amount of floors and thats it. It made the design of the building much easier as well.

              <li *ngFor="let floor of building.floors">
                  Floor {{ floor.number }}: {{ floor.description || "No description" }}
