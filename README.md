# Residential-Building-Management-System

## Overview
This project involves managing different floors, apartments, card scanners (QR codes), along with people and access controls. Key features include:

- Allocation of people to apartments
- Access management
- Maintenance requests
- Audits to show information related to space, personnel, access, and the average resolution time for maintenance issues

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java and SpringBoot (for backend)
- Angular and npm (for frontend)

### Running the Application

1. **Backend**
   - Open IntelliJ and navigate to the `backend` folder of the repository.
   - Run the application created in Spring Boot.

2. **Frontend**
   - Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the `frontend` folder of the repository.
   - In the terminal, run:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - This will start the Angular application, allowing you to view the front end.

## Features
- **Access Control:** Implement access control using QR codes.
- **Audit Generation:** Generate audits to analyze space usage, personnel access, and maintenance response times.



Project that involves different floors,apartments, card scanners (QR codes) along with people and access controls.
There will be allocation of people to apartments along with access and maintainance requests. 
Audits will be generated to show information involving the space, person, access, and the average time it takes to
solve maintenance issues


## Additional notes
This was a project that had a 3 week deadline, we did not accomplish everything that we wanted but I feel that we made
good headway as a 5 person group. As a team we learned a lot and were able to use springboot and angular to provide
some of the functionalities for a building management system. Will definitely revisit this project in the future, it was
good practice and left me with a lot of valuable experiences on how the real world works along with how agile spikes are.
